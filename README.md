# sonicpi-jupyter-notebook
Using [sonicpi](http://sonic-pi.net/) inside [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).

![Example](sonicpi-jupyter.gif)

This is quite useful for educational purposes. For example you can teach sonic pi  using an interactive notebook or as exported Reveal.js slideshow.

To see a real example check the repo for a Sonic Pi crash-course I'm preparing for the technology divulgation event [gitech.cat](http://gitech.cat/): 

https://github.com/victormartingarcia/2018-gitech-introsonicpi (work in progress) 

You can see the material as [Jupyter notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/victormartingarcia/2018-sonicpi-intropandas/blob/master/sonicpi_introduction.ipynb) or as [Reveal.js slides](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/format/slides/github/victormartingarcia/2018-gitech-introsonicpi/blob/master/sonicpi_introduction.ipynb#/)
